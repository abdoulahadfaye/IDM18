            According to a settlement approved on Monday by a Paris court, Crédit Suisse will pay a fine of 123 million euros, and an additional 115 million euros in damages and interest to the French state.

            Crédit Suisse said it had reached the settlement "to resolve an investigation into historical cross-border private-banking services."

            The bank statement streeses that the settlement does not imply any recognition of criminal liability.

            French financial prosecutors opened a probe in 2016 and found that 5,000 French nationals had undeclared Crédit Suisse accounts with assests totalling two billion euros, according to the court.
